    description: 'Life is better with a matcha in hand! Nami comes from the phrase “extra dy(nami)c.” When I started my YouTube channel in 2018, I used “extra dynamic” to describe the energy my siblings brought to my videos. Now, it means much more. It’s the extra spice and sparkle that makes life interesting and fun. Nami is built on the principles of extra dynamic; it’s a matcha meant to brighten your day with a burst of energy, flavor, and color. ',
